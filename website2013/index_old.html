            <h2>About me</h2>I am a Researcher and I study the art and science
            of Cryptology.<br />
            <br />
            Currently, I am affiliated as a Research Personnel with the Centre
            of Excellence in Cryptology at <a href="http://www.isical.ac.in/"
            target="_blank">Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</a>, and I am
            looking for a suitable research and/or teaching position in
            India.<br />
            <br />
            I have recently obtained PhD in Computer Science (Cryptology) from
            Indian Statistical Institute, under the supervision of <a href=
            "http://www.isical.ac.in/~subho" target="_blank">Prof. Subhamoy
            Maitra</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my Masters degree (M.Math.)
            in Pure Mathematics from <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/" target=
            "_blank">University of Waterloo</a>, Canada, in 2008, and my
            Bachelors degree (B.E.Tel.E.) in Electronics and Telecommunication
            Engineering from <a href="http://www.jadavpur.edu/" target=
            "_blank">Jadavpur University</a>, India, in 2006. I spent a year as
            a Graduate student in Mathematics at <a href=
            "http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of
            Washington, Seattle</a>, before joining ISI Kolkata.

            <div class="ssection"></div>

            <h2>Research</h2>My research inclination follows two apparently
            diverse tracks in Cryptology:

            <ul>
                <li>mathematical analysis of cryptographic primitives towards
                discovering their vulnerabilities, and</li>

                <li>efficient engineering of cryptographic designs for high
                performance in practice.</li>
            </ul>In Cryptanalysis, my interests range across theoretical
            problems like statistical analysis of stream ciphers to
            lattice-based attacks on RSA and factorization. I also take active
            interest in practical applications of Cryptology in visual
            cryptographic schemes, key pre-distribution and electronic cash.
            The central theme of my research has always targeted at
            <em>bridging the gap between theory and practice</em> in
            Cryptology.<br />
            <br />
            In addition to my primary interests in Cryptology, I am also
            inclined towards research topics in Number Theory that have close
            ties with cryptographic applications. Distribution of primes,
            primality testing algorithms, the factorization problem, lattice
            based analysis of cryptographic constructions, and topics in
            elliptic curve cryptography pique my interest. Time and again, I
            also like to explore elegant theoretical and computational problems
            in elementary Number Theory.

            <div class="ssection"></div>

            publications. Please feel free to check my <a href=

            publications, if you are interested.

            <h2>Teaching</h2>Teaching is my main motivation towards
            academics.<br />
            <br />
            I have taught several Undergraduate Mathematics course at
            University of Waterloo and University of Washington, both in the
            capacity of a Teaching Assistant and an Instructor. During my
            Doctoral studies at ISI Kolkata, I have taught several introductory
            and research-level sessions on various topics of Cryptology and
            allied disciplines, and have also administered a complete course on
            basic and advanced topics of the subject.<br />
            <br />
            I am interested in teaching any topic within the domain of
            Cryptology and Security at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
            Towards offering graduate level research courses, I have a
            preference for areas within my own research interest - Stream
            Ciphers, Public Key Cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
            I am also interested in teaching any topic within the domain of
            Discrete Mathematics and Number Theory, especially if it is allied
            with practical applications towards Cryptology.
