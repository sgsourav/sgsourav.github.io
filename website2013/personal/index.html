<h2>Cryptology Resources</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>Please check back for some necessary (definitely not sufficient) 
	resources on Cryptology.</p>

<h2>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p class="special">&quot;Open Eyes ... Open Minds ... Open Source&quot;</p>
	<p>I am an enthusiast about learning and using FOSS in my teaching and research 
	activities. My toolbox of choice for mathematics and cryptology is Sage. I 
	will try to maintain a list of references dedicated to Sage and a few other 
	FOSS tools.</p>

<h2>Passions and Hobbies</h2>

    <h2>Travel Schedule</h2>
	<p>Honestly speaking, traveling is very close to my heart. I do not generally miss an opportunity to visit new places, and revisit places that I have been to and liked. My current travel schedule, however, is occupied mainly by conferences, workshops and meetings related to my work and Doctoral studies. Someday, I would like to fill it up with unconditional trips just for pleasure :)</p>
